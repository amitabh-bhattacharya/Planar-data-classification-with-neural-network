# Planar data classification with with neural network

In this project we build a neural network to solve the problem of planer data classification. Here we will learn to:

- Implement a 2-class classification neural network with a single hidden layer
- Use units with a non-linear activation function (tanh)
- Compute the cross entropy loss
- Implement the key concept of neural network, the forward and backward propagation

### Packages
The packages required for this project are:

- numpy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
- sklearn provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis.
- matplotlib is a library for plotting graphs in Python.
- testCases provides some test examples to assess the correctness of our functions
- planar_utils provide various useful functions used in this project

### Dataset
We use the dataset provided by planar_utils in this project. The data looks like a "flower" with some red and some blue points. 

### Project goal
We build a logistic regression and neural network classifiers. The classifiers should predict the regions of the data points as either red or blue. We make a note on the prediction accuracy of logistic regression vs neural netwrok for non-linear dataset.
